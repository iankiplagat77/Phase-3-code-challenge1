# Phase 3 - Week 1, Python Toy Problems

Solving challenges using Python

## Toy Problems

### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
Define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either "am" or "pm") as input.

Your task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

[Challenge 1 Solution](/challenge_one_time_convert.py)

### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive.
Your job is to write a function, which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

### Challenge 3: Consonant value
Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.
